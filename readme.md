# About messages and the paid eduVULCAN app version
If you didn't pay for the extended version of the mobile app, functions related for messages will return `EDUVULCAN_PREMIUM` error.
Please use [this module](https://npmjs.com/@hebece/addon-prometheusweb).

# Notice
This library is highly experimental, if you want to contribute, you can contribute.

Most of the functions is the raw JSON response from the API, so it can be pretty messy.

Every output from functions has it's typings, so it's easier to develop as you already know the fields.

# Usage
